This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started
### Installation
- pre-requisites
  - Have latest node installed.

```bash
npm config set registry https://registry.npmjs.org/
npm config get reigstry
# if vercel deployment, you need to set the registry to the npmjs.org, ensure it is not set to office registry. if it was, delete node_modules and package-lock.json and run npm install again.

npm install next@latest react@latest react-dom@latest

```



First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
